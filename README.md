# COVID Vaccination SQL Data Exploration Project

### In this project I do some data exploration of COVID 19 data, both on the vaccination as well as the death and mortality rate of each country. 
Some of the techniques used are SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, SUM, MAX, CAST, CTEs, and finally creating a view to use in future visualizations
